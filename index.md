**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter were different the different tasks involved with graph structured data such as node classification and graph classification.  
  
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue is how we can avoid oversmoothing and oversquashing when trying to recieve information from nodes further than the immediate neighbors.  
  
**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is to use some sort of global attention system.  
  
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Another technique I would be interested in using in my project is transformers.
